            <h6>A professional project devloped by Xana Adhoc and helmed by Elouise Oyzon from RIT, I worked on it from May to August 2021</h6> 
            <p>Changeling is a VR mystery, first-person 3D platformer game built upon the idea of magical realism and a sense of unease and wonder. You play as Aurelia, a dream-walker whose gift is the ability to see through the eyes of anyone she touches. You are tasked with helping this family figure out what is wrong with their child, and as you contact each member, you see through the lens of their hopes and fears of what the child is.</p>
